- Proving injectivity
	- Direct: take any a, b in A such that a != b, therefore f(a) != f(b)
	- Contrapositive: Assume that a, b, in A are such that f(a) = f(b) therefore a = b
- Proving surjectivity
	- Take an arbitrary element b from B, show that f(x) = b for some x in the domain
- Proving bijectivity
	- Prove that the function is both surjective and injective
- Pigeonhole Principle for functions
	- if |A| > |B|, the function is non injective
	- if |B| > |A|, the function is non surjective
