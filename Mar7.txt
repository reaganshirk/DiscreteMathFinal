- P --> Q
	- Contrapositive: ~Q --> ~P
	- Converse: Q --> P
	- Inverse: ~P --> ~Q
- Contrapositive proof:
	- Given if p, then q
	- Assume ~q
	- Prove ~p
- Congruence of Integers
	- a, b belong to Z, n belongs to N. We say that a and b are congruent modulus n if n|(a - b). 
		- Written as: a (congruence sign) b mod n
	- If a = kn + r where r is the remainder of dividing a by n, then a is congruent to r mod n, n|(a - r), a - r = kn
- Proof by contradiction
	- Assume that ~p is true and come to the conclusion that ~p is false, i.e p is true
