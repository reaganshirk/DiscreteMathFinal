- Properties of Relations:
	- If R is a relation on A, and a,b belong to  A, then aRb can be true or false so it as an open logical statement
	- Properties of relations:
		- Let R be a relation on A. R is said to be:
			- Reflexive if aRa for all a that belongs to A
			- Symmetric if aRb implies bRa for all a,b in A
			- Transitive if when aRb and bRc, then aRc
- Equivalence relations
	- A relation R on a set A is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
	- Let R be an equivalence relation on A. Given any element a in A, the equivalence class containing a is the subset {b belongs to A : bRa} = [a]
