- Distributive Law for Numbers
	- x, y, z belong to the real numbers
	- x(y + z) = xy + xz
- Distributive Law for Sets
	- Intersection = multiplication
	- Union = addition
	- A, B, C are sets
	- A intersection (B union C) = (A intersection B) union (A intersection C)
	- A union (B intersection C) = (A union B) intersection (A union C)
