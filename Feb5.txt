- Definition:
	- We say that lim(a_n) = a if for every epsilon greater than 0, there exists a k such that for ever n greater than k, |a_n - a| < epsilon
	- Negation of this definition:
		- lim(a_n) != a if there exists an epsilon greater than 0 such that for every k, there exists an n greater than k for which |a_n - a| >= epsilon
- Strategies of Proof (non exhaustive list)
	- Modus Ponens (was on Exam 1)
		- [(P --> Q) and (P)] --> Q
		- Proof: show that the above statement is a totality
		P	Q	P -> Q	P -> Q and P	[P->Q and P]->Q
		T	T	T		T			T	
		T	F	F		F			T
		F	T	T		F			T
		F	F	T		F			T
	- Modus Tollens
		- [P --> Q] and (~Q)] --> ~P
	- Transitivity
		- [(P --> Q) and (Q --> R)] --> [P --> Q]
	- Disjunctive Syllogism (Elimination)
		- [(P or Q) and (~P)] --> Q
	- Simplification
		- [P and Q] --> P
		- [P and Q] --> Q
	- Generalization
		- P --> (P or Q)
	- Contradiction
		- [~P --> contradiction] --> P
	- Cases 
		- [(P or Q) and (P --> R) and (Q --> R)] --> R
