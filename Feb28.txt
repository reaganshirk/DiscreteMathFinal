- Direct proofs
	- Axions: self obvious things
	- Theorems: build on axions
		- Lemma: a small theorem that is used in the proof of another result
		- Proposition: an "easier" theorem
	- For a direct proof: 
		- If P, then A
		- Assume that P is true and use the rules of logic to show that Q is true
- Definitions:
	- An integer is even if n = 2a
	- An integer is odd if n = 2a + 1
	- 2 integers have the same parity if they are both even or both odd. If not they have the opposite parity
	- We say that A divides B (A|B) if B = AC
	- A number is prime if it has exaclty 2 divisors, 1 and itself. Otherwise it is composite
	- The greatest common divisor of a,b is the largest integer that divides both a and b.
	- The least common multiple of a,b is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both a and b
- The division algorithm
	- Given integers a, b with b > 0, there exists unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, o <= r < b, a = q/b with remainder r
- Common Proof Mistakes:
	- Arguing from examples
	- Using the same letter for different varaibles/meanings
	- Jumping to conclusion
	- Circular reasoning
	- Confusion between what is known and what needs to be shown
	- Confusion between "any" and "some"
