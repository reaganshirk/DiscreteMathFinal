- Disproof
	- Given P, prove ~P
	- Given for every x in S, P(x), prove that there exists an x in S, ~P(x)
- Mathematical induction:
	- Prove that the statements s1, s2, s3, ... are all true
		- Step 1: prove S1
		- Step 2: Assume that Sk is true for some k that belongs to N
		- Prove that Sk+1 is true
