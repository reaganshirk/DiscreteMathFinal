- Relation concepts
	- relations
	- equivalence relations
	- partitions
	- functions
		- injective, surjective, bijective
- Composition functions
	- g(f(a)) or f(g(a))
	- if f(g()) and g(f()) are both defined, then f(g()) != g(f()) in general
	- Composition functions are associative
		- h of (g of f) = (h of g) of f
	- If both f and g are injective, then g of f is injective, same with surjective
- Inverse function
	- A function must be bijective to have an inverse
	- For a set A, the identity on A is i_a: A --> A is defined by i_a(a) = a
	- A bijective function F: A --> B means that f is a subset of A x B
	- Given a relation R from A to B, the inverse relation is defined as R^-1 = {(b, a) : a, b belong to R}
