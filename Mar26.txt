- Proofs involving sets
	- Proving a belongs to A
		- A = {x : P(x)}
		- To prove that a belongs to A, must show that P(a) is true
		- A = {x belongs to X : P(x)}
		- To prove that a belongs to A, must show that:
			- a belongs to X
			- P(a) is true
- Proving that A is a subset of B
	- A is a subset of B if a belongs to A implies a belongs to B for every a that belongs to A.
	- Direct proof:
		- Suppose a belongs to A, therefore a belongs to B, so A is a subset of B
	- Contrapositive proof:
		- a does not belong to B implies that a does not belong to A
- Proving that A = B 
	- A = B means that A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A
	- To prove, prove that:
		- A is a subset of B
			- show that for every a that belongs to A, a belongs to A implies a belongs to B
		- B is a subset of A
			- show that for every b that belongs to B, b belongs to B implies b belongs to A
